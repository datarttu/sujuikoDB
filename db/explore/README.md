# `db/explore`

These exploration scripts are just stuff I have tried out along the way of development, and some of them have been finally implemented on the DDL side.
They are NOT part of the actual application logic, and most of them worked in some earlier database state but probably not any more.
The scripts are here only to document part of the development efforts and to help managing larger tests I consider too large to write interactively in the console.
